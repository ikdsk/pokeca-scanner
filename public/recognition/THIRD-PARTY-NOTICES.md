# Third-party notices — local/internal evaluation only

This is a modified CollectorVision scanner. Upstream: HanClinto/CollectorVision,
commit `2a122d00d25c8d112a90e47bf235a021e0c53b0c`.
`scanner.worker.mjs` and `lib/collectorvision-catalog-v2.mjs` are from that
repository and retain its AGPL-3.0 terms. Full license: `LICENSE-AGPL-3.0.txt`.
Authors and contributors retain their copyrights. No separate commercial or
noncommercial license has been obtained. The worker is modified to pin assets,
force one-thread WASM, verify model hashes, bound downloads, allow a local asset
mirror, retain init messages during runtime import, and return a margin between the best and second-best catalog rows plus the top-5 matches (tcgplayer/pokemon-japan). The catalog client
is modified to retain a previously complete,
compatible cached snapshot when an update fails. Runtime import and local gzip
transport were corrected. This application is not represented as MIT licensed.

Cornelius 2.12: HanClinto/cornelius @
`9280009f5a66f75f952820d9dadb894909b759b7`, AGPL-3.0 model-card declaration.
Milo 1.0.0: HanClinto/milo @ `9bcc5e809e936b8c5630d1e7101aae1de1e76621`,
AGPL-3.0 model-card declaration. Models are downloaded, never committed.

CollectorVisionCatalog `tcgplayer/pokemon-japan` (embedding family milo1, source
tcgplayer, result identifier `tcgplayer_product`): pinned base v10 + deltas v11-v16
(current_version 16, 27,593 rows), feed checked_at 2026-10-04T13:15:12Z, fetched
2026-10-05. The bundled feed snapshot is that catalog entry only, with already-folded
deltas v1-v10 removed. This app commits only the descriptor/URLs/hashes, not catalog
data or images. CollectorVision treats non-MTG catalogs as a PREVIEW: they are less
validated than the MTG catalog, and recognition accuracy on physical cards, printing
variants (e.g. "Poke Ball Pattern" products share set and number with the normal
card), language and finish is not established. Catalog repository software MIT license
does not establish rights to underlying card data, images, or embedding redistribution.
Review these separately before public use.

Public hosting, network use or distribution requires explicit release approval
and a full compliance decision, including AGPL Corresponding Source access for
the combined application, model/data/image rights and any third-party notices.
A private GitHub repository alone does not fulfill a public source-offer duty.
The localhost internal experiment is not a release authorization.
